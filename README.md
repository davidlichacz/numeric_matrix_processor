# Numeric Matrix Processor

Matrices have a wide range of applications in programming: they're used for digital image processing, graph representation and algorithms on a graph, graphic effects, applied math, statistics, and much more.

## Stage 1
In this stage, you should write a program that:

Reads matrix AA from the input.
Reads matrix BB from the input.
Outputs their sum if it is possible to add them. Otherwise, it should output the ERROR message.
Each matrix in the input is given in the following way: the first line contains the number of rows nn and the number of columns mm. Then nn lines follow, each containing mm integers representing one row of the matrix.

Output the result in the same way but don't print the dimensions of the matrix.

## Stage 2
In this stage, you are going to implement the multiplication of a matrix by a constant. To do this, you need to multiply every element of the matrix by that constant. 

Write a program that reads a matrix and a constant and outputs the result of their multiplication.

The first line of the input contains the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix. Next lines contain rows of the matrix. The last line contains the constant.

The constant and the elements of the matrix are integers.
